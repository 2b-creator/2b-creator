I am a boy, an autistic young man who can do a little bit of anything. I update as I see fit, whenever I think of it. If you were to put some label on me, I think the word "erbia(2b)" is actually quite suitable.

However, I consider myself a "group" young man, and a technical nerd who prefers to help others. But the prerequisite for helping others is that the other party has a good attitude, clear logs and detailed answers.
