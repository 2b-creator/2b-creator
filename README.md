## This is me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working with C#
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and Python
- 😄 Pronouns: 2b / erbia

I’m a guy who falls somewhere on the autism spectrum—and honestly, I can do a bit of everything. I update this whenever it crosses my mind or feels right. If you had to put a label on me, “erbia” (or 2b) actually fits pretty well.

That said, I see myself more as part of a “collective” kind of person—someone who enjoys helping others and diving into tech. But if you want my help, there’s one rule: be respectful, provide clear logs, and give detailed answers.

So,
